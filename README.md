Hi, this is Haoling Wang, currently an undergraduate student in Univesity of Nottingham, Ningbo China
<br>
This is the stata code file for my independent undergraduate research project: COVID-19 and the Uneven Impact on Pharmaceutical Innovation: Evidence from China and the EU. I uploaded all the code for my paper to show how I run the regressions and check for the robustness. 
<br>
The initial abstract is as follows: This study investigates the heterogeneous impact of COVID-19 on pharmaceutical R&D investment in China and the EU. Using a Difference-in-Differences framework,
it can be found that Chinese firms significantly increased R&D expenditure relative to EU counterparts, driven by stronger institutional support. The effect is more pronounced among firms with higher profits, capital investment, and workforce size.
These findings highlight how both internal capacity and institutional context shape firmsâ€™ innovation responses to crisis shocks, offering insights for future health innovation policy under uncertainty.
